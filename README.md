The purpose of this project is analyzing the train stations of India in Python using graph
theory and including using different algorithms such as BFS DFS Dijkstra Bellman-Ford and etc.
In this report the used algorithms, ways are discussed and shown some results. On the other hand,
the code has been commented for better understanding.
